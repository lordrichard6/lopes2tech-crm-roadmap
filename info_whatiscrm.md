# What is CRM? - Step Explanations

## Main Concept

**"A Customer Relationship Management system is your central hub for managing all customer interactions, sales processes, and business relationships."**

A CRM centralizes all customer data in one place, making it easy to track every interaction and manage relationships effectively.

## ROI Statistic

**ROI (Return on Investment)** measures how much value you get back compared to what you invest. It's calculated as: (Gain - Cost) / Cost.

**According to Nucleus Research, CRM delivers an average return of $8.71 for every dollar spent.**

This means for every 1 CHF you invest in CRM, you get 8.71 CHF back in value (through increased sales, time savings, and better customer retention). This research-backed number shows that CRM is a proven investment with measurable returns.
