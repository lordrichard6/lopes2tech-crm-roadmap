# CRM Requirements - Step Explanations

## Main Concept

Essential features and capabilities needed for a CRM system tailored to insurance and financial advisory operations.

---

## Critical Business Needs

These are the most important requirements that the CRM must address for the business to function effectively.

### 1. Multi-Location Management
**Priority: Critical**

Coordinate operations and data across multiple office locations. All offices need real-time access to the same customer data and processes.

---

### 2. Dual Customer Segmentation
**Priority: Critical**

Separate workflows for B2C (individual customers) and B2B (business clients). These two types of customers have different needs, sales processes, and documentation requirements.

---

### 3. Complex Product Portfolio
**Priority: High**

Manage 15+ different insurance and finance products. Each product has different rules, pricing, and documentation. The CRM needs to handle this complexity efficiently.

---

### 4. Regulatory Compliance
**Priority: Critical**

Meet FINMA requirements and Swiss data protection laws. Financial services are heavily regulated, and the CRM must ensure all operations comply with legal requirements.

**What is FINMA?** FINMA (Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority) is Switzerland's financial regulator. It oversees banks, insurance companies, and financial advisors to ensure they follow Swiss financial laws and protect customers.

---

### 5. Client Lifecycle Management
**Priority: High**

Track customers from their first contact (lead) all the way through policy renewal. This ensures no customer falls through the cracks at any stage.

---

### 6. Partner Network Integration
**Priority: High**

Connect with multiple insurance providers. Financial advisors work with various insurance companies, so the CRM needs to integrate with their systems.

---

### 7. Multilingual Support
**Priority: High**

Support German, French, Italian, and English. Switzerland has multiple official languages, so the system must work in all of them.
